Elevator Pitch: PitchMaestro is an app to help musicians detect pitch and play musical notes.

Functional Description: PitchMaestro has two main features: a pitch detector and a note player. The pitch detector displays the note, frequency, and pitch accuracy of the sound produced by the user. The pitch accuracy will be displayed via a “pitch meter” which will turn green when the sound is “in tune”. The note player spans eight octaves and allows the user to play multiple notes at a time. The note player has a basic format consisting of just eight notes and an advanced format displaying all of the notes. Bonus features include a functional keyboard, a voice part test, a pitch quiz game, and the ability to play notes from different instruments.  

Technical Description: PitchMaestro utilizes the built-in microphone and speaker. 

Potential Impact(s): PitchMaestro is a one-stop-shop for music lovers and musicians alike. It provides the functionality of a pitch pipe and helps users hone their pitch.
